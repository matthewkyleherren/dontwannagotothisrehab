You want to help them, but you don\u2019t know how. You want them to get better, but you\u2019re not sure they even see the problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>At Abbington House, we support families, partners, and friends who are navigating this difficult path. Whether your loved one is ready for rehab, in denial or somewhere in between, this isn&#8217;t something you have to do alone.<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Their Addiction Affects You Too<\/h3>\n\n<p>Addiction affects more than one person. It impacts the people closest to them emotionally, mentally and sometimes even physically.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be feeling:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helpless, watching them spiral but not knowing how to stop it<\/li>\n\n<li>Angry or resentful, after broken promises and repeated let-downs<\/li>\n\n<li>Confused, unsure what\u2019s addiction and what\u2019s choice<\/li>\n\n<li>Exhausted, trying to \u2018manage\u2019 it behind closed doors<\/li>\n\n<li>Scared of what might happen next, or how far things might go.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These feelings are completely valid, and they are not signs of weakness or failure. They show that you care deeply, but you deserve support too.<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When Should You Reach Out?<\/h3>\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to wait for things to get worse before you seek help. In fact, the sooner you understand your options, the better prepared you\u2019ll be for them and for yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Common signs your loved one may need professional support:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They\u2019ve tried to quit drinking or using drugs, but can\u2019t<\/li>\n\n<li>Their behaviour has changed (mood swings, secrecy, anger)<\/li>\n\n<li>They\u2019ve withdrawn from friends, work, or family responsibilities<\/li>\n\n<li>You find yourself constantly worrying, watching, or \u2018cleaning up\u2019 after them<\/li>\n\n<li>You\u2019re walking on eggshells more often than not<\/li>\n\n<li>You feel as though the person you once knew is completely different<\/li>\n\n<li>You are considering leaving them, but the pain of watching them suffer leaves you in a difficult position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How We Can Help You and Them<\/h3>\n\n<p>Abbington House is a trauma-informed, private rehab centre based in Hertfordshire. We offer a safe, professional space where people can recover and families can find relief.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you contact us, we can:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Help you understand whether rehab is the right next step<\/li>\n\n<li>Talk you through how our programme works<\/li>\n\n<li>Guide you on how to approach a conversation with your loved one<\/li>\n\n<li>Support you emotionally, even if they\u2019re not ready for help yet<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>We never pressure anyone into treatment. Trying to force someone into treatment is likely to yield little benefit, but we can offer the necessary guidance for putting in place important boundaries. This is just as much about protecting you as it is them.<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Talk to Your Loved One About Rehab<\/h3>\n\n<p>We know how hard these conversations can be. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to help you prepare for them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some helpful tips include:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Choose the right time<\/strong>: Avoid high-stress or intoxicated moments<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Lead with concern, not accusation<\/strong>: e.g. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about you&#8221; instead of &#8220;You need to stop&#8221;<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Offer information, not ultimatums<\/strong>: Let them know help is available &#8211; but avoid triggering defensiveness at this stage<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Focus on impact<\/strong>: Gently explain how it\u2019s affecting you and others<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Have support in place<\/strong>: We can be that support if you need us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&gt; <a href=\"\/admissions\/\">Learn about our admissions process<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What If They Say No?<\/h3>\n\n<p>Not everyone is ready the first time the subject comes up or even the 50th time. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed. And it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll never change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often, just planting the seed gently and compassionately is enough to start the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can still:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set boundaries to protect yourself<\/li>\n\n<li>Get emotional support from professionals<\/li>\n\n<li>Stay connected to us, so when they are ready, you know what to do next.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our Promise to Families<\/h3>\n\n<p>At Abbington House, we never forget that addiction affects families too. That\u2019s why we treat you with the same care, honesty, and respect that we offer to our residents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whether your loved one enters treatment with us or not, we will support you as you navigate this complex journey.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIt was a huge relief to speak to someone who actually listened. They didn\u2019t push. They helped me understand what was happening and what I could do without losing myself.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&#8211; Partner of a former resident.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Not Alone in This<\/h3>\n\n<p>Supporting someone with addiction is hard. But you don\u2019t have to carry that burden alone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s possible, and what help could look like.<\/p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" \/>\n<p><strong>Explore next:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/residential-rehab\/family-therapy\/\">Family Support in Rehab \u2192<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When someone you love is struggling with addiction, it can feel like you\u2019re carrying the weight of two lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":38889,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[113],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-47419","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-addiction-help"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47419","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=47419"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47419\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48091,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47419\/revisions\/48091"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/38889"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=47419"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=47419"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=47419"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
