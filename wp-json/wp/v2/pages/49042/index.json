We help you manage these symptoms and stabilise your emotions with full support.<\/li>\n<li>Heroin & Opiates - Coming off opiates like heroin or prescription painkillers (codeine, morphine, oxycodone) requires a medically managed detox plan. We provide safe opioid withdrawal protocols, with round-the-clock monitoring.<\/li>\n<li>Cannabis - While often underestimated, cannabis withdrawal can cause irritability, insomnia, appetite changes, and anxiety. Our team provides non-judgmental care in a peaceful, structured environment.<\/li>\n<li>Ketamine - We support individuals coming off ketamine, particularly those struggling with bladder issues, dissociation, or mental fog. A combination of medical care and therapy is often helpful here.<\/li>\n<li>Prescription Medications - This includes benzodiazepines (like diazepam or Xanax), sleeping pills, antidepressants, and stimulant medications. These require slow, supervised tapering for safety.<\/li>\n<li>Polydrug Use - Many people use combinations of drugs (e.g. cocaine + alcohol, opioids + benzos). We develop a tailored detox plan that prioritises your safety, comfort, and long-term stability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether you need detox, we can help you assess your situation in confidence.
