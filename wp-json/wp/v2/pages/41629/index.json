Unlike outpatient or NHS treatment, residential rehab allows you to step away from the chaos and triggers of daily life, giving your body and mind the space to stabilise and recover.\u00a0<\/p><p>At Abbington House, we treat alcohol addiction as a response to something deeper. Alcohol use is often a symptom of trauma, anxiety, unresolved grief, or even undiagnosed neurodivergence. That\u2019s why our care model goes beyond symptom management, we provide a full therapeutic framework that explores the why behind the drinking, not just the drinking itself.<\/p><h3>Core Elements of Our Programme<\/h3><p>Every private rehab facility is different, but the most effective centres (like ours) offer:<\/p><ul><li>Medically supported <a href=\"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/alcohol-rehab\/alcohol-detox\/\">alcohol detox<\/a> to manage\u00a0alcohol withdrawal\u00a0safely<\/li><li>One-to-one\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/alcohol-rehab\/therapy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alcohol addiction therapy<\/a> tailored to your life, history and goals<\/li><li>Group therapy focused on connection, community, and shared experience<\/li><li>Holistic modalities, such as breathwork, nutrition, art therapy, or movement<\/li><li>Family involvement, where appropriate, is to rebuild trust and understanding<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/alcohol-rehab\/aftercare\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aftercare planning<\/a>, relapse prevention, and long-term support frameworks.<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-51a6606 cmsmasters-block-default cmsmasters-sticky-default elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"51a6606\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Treating the <span style=\"color: #9ea283;\">Whole<\/span> Person<\/h2><p>When someone develops an <a href=\"https:\/\/abbingtonhouse.co.uk\/alcohol-addiction\/what-is-alcohol-addiction\/\">alcohol use disorder<\/a>, it\u2019s usually a sign of deeper issues where alcohol has become a way of coping. \u00a0At Abbington House, it&#8217;s our job to help you understand what\u2019s driving this behaviour, and we do so by adopting a comprehensive, holistic approach to treatment.

These skills play a vital role when it comes to relapse prevention and encouraging person growth. It may feel like a lot of work, but your recovery is worth it.<\/p>\n<h2>The Recommended Length of Alcohol Rehab Treatment<\/h2>\n<p>Research suggests that the most effective treatment duration for alcohol addiction is at least 28 days. This allows enough time to address both the physical and psychological aspects of addiction, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and establish a solid recovery plan.<\/p>\n<p>Many people opt for detox-only programmes; however, developing new coping strategies to prepare you for life outside of rehab is a vital part of the process which is why we believe our clients will benefit most from longer stays, depending on their specific needs and recovery goals.<\/p>\n<p>However, treatment is not one-size-fits-all. Some individuals may require longer stays to fully benefit from the structured support of an alcohol rehab centre. At Abbington House, we work with each person to determine the right length of stay based on their needs and circumstances.<\/p>\n<h2>Supporting Loved Ones<\/h2>\n<p>Addiction is very often referred to as a &#8216;family disease&#8217; and impacts everyone around you. Whilst we&#8217;re stuck in the cycle of addiction, we&#8217;re often unaware of the emotional pain, stress and trauma our loved ones are experiencing. Facilitating honest and open conversations between family members and helping them heal is a huge part of the recovery process.<\/p>\n<p>Family involvement can greatly improve recovery outcomes because support from loved ones provides people with the motivation to continue their journey, as well as offering accountability and a sense of connection that strengthens long-term sobriety. However, it\u2019s important for family members to have their own space to heal and process their experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Addiction can strain or even break relationships, which can lead to resentment, hurt and mistrust. Acknowledging and addressing these issues is so important if you want to rebuild a healthy family dynamic. Open communication, boundary-setting and professional guidance by our therapists can help you restore the relationships damaged by addiction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We offer support for families through:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Family therapy to facilitate open and honest conversations<\/li>\n<li>Education on addiction and recovery to help loved ones better understand addiction and recovery<\/li>\n<li>Support groups for families to connect with other people facing similar challenges.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Providing useful resources for both clients and their loved ones means we can help their families heal together, giving them another chance at a stronger family unit.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bcec069 cmsmasters-block-default cmsmasters-sticky-default elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"bcec069\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Admissions and Cost<\/h2>\n<p>We know that entering rehab is a big step.

However, for many people, rock bottom is far too late. Instead, recognising some of the common signs of alcohol use disorder can help you detect the problem early. Alcohol addiction is a gradual illness so these signs might not appear obvious at first. Changes in behaviour such as neglecting responsibilities, withdrawing from loved ones or continuing to drink despite the consequences often indicate a problem. Secrecy around drinking, hiding alcohol or making excuses for excessive drinking are also signs you should not ignore.&lt;\\\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;8b62f61&quot;,&quot;content_type&quot;:&quot;toggle-content&quot;,&quot;saved_section&quot;:null,&quot;saved_template&quot;:null,&quot;saved_widget&quot;:null,&quot;item_icon&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;library&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;toggle_custom_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;toggle_title&quot;:&quot;How long does treatment last?&quot;,&quot;toggle_content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Your treatment length will depend on a few different factors, such as your detox requirements, whether you have any co-occurring disorders that need to be addressed and how your personal circumstances such as work and home life.

To truly overcome an illness as debilitating as alcohol addiction treat the psychological and emotional factors that are contributing to it.
